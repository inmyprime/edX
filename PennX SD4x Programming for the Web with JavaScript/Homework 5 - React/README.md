#### Homework 5 - React

---
In this assignment, you will develop a simple application to track lists of items using React.

The application you will be building has many components that work together in order to organize multiple lists. Such an app could theoretically be used to create a shopping list, a set of daily tasks, or so forth.

In completing this assignment, you will:

* Gain experience understanding and modifying an existing React app
* Use the Node framework to create and deploy a React app with multiple components defined in separate files
* Gain more experience in implementing callback functions in React components that affect the components’ appearance
* Apply what you have learned in the lessons about the relationships between React components and how components interact

##### Usage

1. Install Node.js locally by downloading it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. From the Terminal, Command Prompt, etc. update Node Package Manager by typing the command: npm install npm –g

3. Install the create-react-app package by typing the command: npm install –g create-react-app

4. Create a new folder or directory for your project, then navigate to it using Terminal, Command Prompt, etc.

5. Create the project by typing the command: create-react-app lists  
This will create a “lists” directory and install the default React app there.

6. Copy index.html into the “public/” directory of your React project; this will overwrite the default index.html that is already there.

7. Copy the seven .js files and App.css into the “src/” directory of your React project; this will overwrite the default index.js, App.js and App.css that are already there.

8. You can start the app by changing to the “lists” directory and typing the command: npm start

You should then be able to access http://localhost:3000 using your web browser and see the app
