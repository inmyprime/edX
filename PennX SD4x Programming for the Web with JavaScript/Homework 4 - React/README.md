#### Homework 4 - React

---
In this assignment, you will develop a React component that allows the reader of a web page to change the appearance of a piece of text.

When the user clicks on the text, a small form will appear that contains:

* a checkbox that lets the user choose whether the text should be bold
* buttons for decreasing and increasing the textâ€™s font size, as well as a display of the current size

Then, when the user clicks on the text again, the form disappears. Further details of the specification are provided below.

In completing this assignment, you will:

* Use the React framework to create a reusable, modular component
* Define callback functions that are invoked as the result of user actions in the HTML page
* Use those callback functions to modify the attributes of HTML elements
