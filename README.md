## PennX: SD4x Programming for the Web with JavaScript

#### Homework 1-3
Open .html files in Chrome 

#### Homework 4
Open .html file in Firefox, click "Hello" to see the font chooser

#### Homework 5
1. Install Node.js locally by downloading it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. From the Terminal, Command Prompt, etc. update Node Package Manager by typing the command: npm install npm –g

3. Install the create-react-app package by typing the command: npm install –g create-react-app

4. Create a new folder or directory for your project, then navigate to it using Terminal, Command Prompt, etc.

5. Create the project by typing the command: create-react-app lists  
This will create a “lists” directory and install the default React app there.

6. Copy index.html into the “public/” directory of your React project; this will overwrite the default index.html that is already there.

7. Copy the seven .js files and App.css into the “src/” directory of your React project; this will overwrite the default index.js, App.js and App.css that are already there.

8. You can start the app by changing to the “lists” directory and typing the command: npm start

You should then be able to access http://localhost:3000 using your web browser and see the app

#### Homework 6
1. Create a new folder or directory for your project, then navigate to it using Terminal, Command Prompt, etc.

2. Initialize the project by typing the command: npm init

3. Install Express by typing the command: npm install express --save

4. Install Mongoose by typing the command: npm install mongoose --save

5. Copy all three files to the directory that is the root of your Node Express project, i.e. the directory where you ran “npm init”. 

6. Create an account to use a cloud service such as MongoDB Atlas (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

7. In MongoDB Atlas, Clusters -> CONNECT -> Copy a connection string -> I am using driver 3.4 or earlier -> Copy the URI connection string

8. In Animal.js and Toy.js, replace the parameter of mongoose.connect with your connection string.

9. Replace PASSWORD with the password for your MongoDB Atlas user. Please note that any special characters in your password (%, @, and :) will need to be URL encoded.

10. Use Terminal or Command Prompt to navigate to the root directory of your Node Express project and type the command: node index.js

You should see the message “Listening on port 3000”. Then use your web browser to access http://localhost:3000.
